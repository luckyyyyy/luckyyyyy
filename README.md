# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Full Stack Developer / Software Engineer / Technical Product Manager

 * I'm a full-stack developer and a technical product manager, specializing in tool products, developer products, enterprise service products, and testing products.
 * I have extensive development experience, have been in the internet industry for 20 years, and have been coding for 15 years.
 * I have high standards for the user experience of products.
 * Currently, my main focus in development is frontend and cloud-native applications, and I'm also well-versed in networking, operating systems, and storage.
 * I have a passion for technology and hardware, and I'm also a white-hat hacker.
 * I mostly code in JavaScript, Go, C, and Rust, but I'm not limited to any specific programming language.
